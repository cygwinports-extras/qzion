ldesc: "QZion is an canvas abstraction used by and made for QEdje. As it 
is an abstraction, different implementations can exist, making it 
possible to optimize QEdje for different platforms/devices. Currently an 
implementation, based on KGameCanvas (from libkdegames) exists, but work 
is being done on providing an implementation using QT's QGraphicsView."
